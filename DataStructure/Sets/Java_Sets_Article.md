# Understanding Sets in Java and How to Create Them

## Introduction

In Java, a `Set` is a part of the Java Collections Framework, an essential tool for managing collections of objects. Unlike a `List`, a `Set` is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. This property makes `Set` an excellent choice when you want to ensure that a collection contains only unique elements.

There are several implementations of the `Set` interface in Java, including `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, and `TreeSet`. Each of these has different characteristics in terms of performance and ordering. In this article, we'll explore how to create and use these sets in Java.

## What is a Set?

A `Set` in Java is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction. Java provides several implementations of the `Set` interface, the most common of which are:

- **`HashSet`:** It stores elements in a hash table, providing constant-time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains. However, it does not maintain any order of elements.
  
- **`LinkedHashSet`:** It is a subclass of `HashSet` that maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, in the order in which they were inserted. This allows the set to maintain insertion order.

- **`TreeSet`:** It is a `NavigableSet` implementation based on a `TreeMap`. The elements in a `TreeSet` are stored in a sorted order.
