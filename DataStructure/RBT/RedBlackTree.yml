RedBlackTree:
  Basics:
    NodesAndColors:
      - Each node has a value
      - Each node has a color (red or black)
    Properties:
      - Root Property: The root is always black
      - Red Property: Red nodes cannot have red children (no two red nodes can be adjacent)
      - Black Property: Every path from a node to its descendant leaves has the same number of black nodes
      - Leaf Property: All leaves (NIL nodes) are black

  InsertionAndBalancing:
    Process:
      - Insert node using standard binary search tree insertion
      - Fix violations of Red-Black Tree properties through rotations and recoloring

  FurtherInsertionsSummary:
    Insertions: "5 to 100"
    Process:
      - Insert node as a red node following binary search tree rules
      - Fix violations through:
        - Recoloring: Changing the color of nodes
        - Rotations: Performing left or right rotations to maintain balance

  Conclusion:
    Summary:
      - Red-Black Trees dynamically adjust through rotations and recoloring
      - Properties ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations
      - Understanding balancing mechanisms is key for effective use
